# -Machine-Learning-Analysis-of-New-Coder-Survey-Data

This project presents an individual project that applies machine learning techniques to analyze real-world data from "the 2018 freeCodeCamp New Coder Survey". The primary objective is to gain insights into the characteristics of new coders and predict their income levels based on various attributes. The dataset is publicly available on Kaggle: Dataset Link.

Introduction In this project, I implement machine learning tasks using Python programming, adhering to the CRISP-DM methodology. The primary tasks include exploratory data analysis, cluster analysis, and classification using machine learning algorithms. Through these tasks, I aim to gain a deeper understanding of the dataset and extract meaningful insights.

Data Understanding, Preprocessing, and Exploratory Data Analysis The dataset comprises numerous columns with diverse information about new coders. To perform meaningful analysis, I carefully selected relevant features, emphasizing their impact on income prediction. The selected attributes include both numeric and categorical variables related to demographic and technical skills. These features were chosen based on their potential influence on income levels.

Data preprocessing involved assessing the data quality, identifying and addressing issues such as duplicate instances, missing values, outliers, and erroneous values. I applied data transformation and normalization techniques to prepare the dataset for further analysis.

Exploratory data analysis was conducted to visualize the dataset's distribution and relationships among features. Histograms, box plots, scatter plots, and pie charts were utilized to uncover insights into attribute characteristics and potential correlations.

Cluster Analysis The data underwent transformation and normalization for cluster analysis. I employed clustering methods such as k-Means and hierarchical clustering to categorize new coders into distinct clusters based on their attributes. The optimal number of clusters was determined through appropriate techniques. I describe the characteristics of each cluster to identify patterns and trends.

Machine Learning for Classification Classification methods, including k-Nearest Neighbour, Decision Trees, and Logistic Regression, were employed to predict whether a developer is in a high-income category. Hyper-parameter tuning and ensemble methods were implemented to optimize model performance. The workflow of machine learning for classification was represented with a flowchart.

Evaluation of Machine Learning Models The performance of various machine learning models was evaluated and compared using metrics such as accuracy, confusion matrix, recall, precision, and ROC curve. Results were presented through tables and figures, and the impact of hyper-parameter tuning on model performance was critically reviewed.

Discussions and Conclusions In conclusion, this coursework leverages machine learning techniques to analyze the 2018 freeCodeCamp New Coder Survey data. The selected features, cluster characteristics, and classification models collectively provide insights into the attributes influencing new coders' income levels. The project enhances understanding of machine learning methodologies and their application to real-world datasets.
